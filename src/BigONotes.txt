1) Different steps get added
2) Drop constants
3) Different inputs have different variables that represent them
4) Drop non-dominate terms (Smaller terms don't matter)

Big O Shorthands
1) Arithmetic operations are constant
2) Variable assignment is constant
3) Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant
4) In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens in the loop
