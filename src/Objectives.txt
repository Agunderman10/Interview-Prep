1) Trees (especially BST)
2) Big O Notation
3) Hash Tables
4) Object Oriented Design/Systems Design
5) Algorithms: Breadth First Search/Depth First Search, Binary Search log(n) time complexity, Merge Sort, 
Quick Sort,
6) Arrays
7) Recursion
8) Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
9) Stacks/Queues
10) Bit Manipulation
11) Memoization


- Matching Parenthesis(Brackets) Question. Is correct? Or next bracket you have to add. Can use a stack. If stack
isn't empty you know not all of the brackets were matched.
- Hash Tables are good for caching
- Be able to manipulate multiple pointers at once
- Reversing a Linked List
- Sorting Fundamentals (Run times) Big O is nlog(n) for a lot of sorting algorithms
- Construct custom data structure
- Binary search log(n) time complexity
